1. Bounded Rationality

   Definition: People have limited cognitive resources, time, and information, leading them to make satisfactory rather than optimal decisions.

   Key Thinker: Herbert Simon

2. Prospect Theory

   Definition: People value gains and losses differently, leading to decision-making that deviates from rationality. Key aspects include loss aversion, reference dependence, and diminishing sensitivity.

   Key Thinkers: Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky

3. Loss Aversion

   Definition: The pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining.

   Example: People are more likely to avoid losses than to seek equivalent gains.

4. Endowment Effect

   Definition: People assign more value to things they own compared to things they do not own.

   Example: Sellers often price their possessions higher than buyers are willing to pay.

    Example: Stock market bubbles driven by collective investor behavior.

17. Sunk Cost Fallacy

    Definition: Continuing an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, even when it is not rational to do so.

    Example: Continuing to invest in a failing project because of the amount already invested.

18. Choice Overload

    Definition: Having too many options can lead to decision paralysis and dissatisfaction.

    Example: Shoppers feeling overwhelmed and less satisfied when faced with too many product choices.

    Example: Consumers are more likely to notice and respond to sales with bold signage or highlighted prices.

22. Priming

    Definition: Exposure to one stimulus influences a response to a subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention.

    Example: People exposed to words related to old age (like "wrinkle" or "retirement") may walk more slowly afterward.

23. Temporal Discounting

    Definition: The tendency to discount rewards more heavily the further in the future they are.

    Example: Preferring $50 now over $100 in a year.

24. Hot-Cold Empathy Gap

    Example: Underestimating how hunger might influence one's grocery shopping choices.

25. Ambiguity Aversion

    Definition: Preference for known risks over unknown risks.

    Example: Investors may avoid stocks or assets with uncertain information even if they offer potentially higher returns.

26. Projection Bias

    Definition: The tendency to project current preferences onto future decisions.

    Example: Overestimating future happiness from purchasing a luxury item based on current excitement.

27. Zero-Risk Bias

    Definition: Preference for reducing a small risk to zero over a larger reduction in a bigger risk.

    Example: Prioritizing the elimination of minor risks in daily life over mitigating more significant risks that cannot be completely eliminated.

28. Planning Fallacy

    Definition: Underestimating the time, costs, and risks of future actions while overestimating the benefits.

    Example: Projects often taking longer and costing more than initially planned.

29. Affect Heuristic

    Definition: Decisions are influenced by emotions and feelings rather than by rational analysis.

    Example: People might avoid investing in stocks because of a recent market crash that invoked fear, regardless of current market conditions.

30. Bandwagon Effect

    Definition: The tendency to do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same.

    Example: Following fashion trends or buying popular gadgets because everyone else is doing it.

31. Contrast Effect

    Definition: The enhancement or diminishment of perception, cognition, or related performance due to exposure to a stimulus of lesser or greater value.

    Example: A product appearing more attractive when placed next to a less appealing alternative.

32. Decoy Effect

    Definition: Preferences for one option change when a third, less attractive option is introduced.

    Example: Dressing in a certain way to fit in with a group.

## Neuroscience

    Implication: Decision-making processes can be influenced and altered through learning and experience.

2.  Amygdala Hijack
    Definition: The process by which the amygdala, the brain's emotional center, overrides the prefrontal cortex, leading to an emotional response that is disproportionate to the situation.
    Example: Reacting with intense fear to a minor threat.

## Developmental Psychology
